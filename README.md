About this repository1
---
This is the Github repository for my website. When you access my website, you're really getting these files.

I'll be adding a blog shortly, most likely using Jekyll (since static content generation is nice). 

I'm not 100% sure whether or not I'll continue using Github pages for my site, since of course I still have my own server, which is nice simply because it's me managing it. On the other hand, Github has pretty good stability.
